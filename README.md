    <h2>Seamlessly Sync Facebook Leads with ERPNext</h2>
</div>

**Mansico Meta Integration** is an open-source application designed to automate the synchronization of Facebook leads with ERPNext. When clients fill out Facebook Ads instant forms, the app automatically fetches the newly created leads and generates corresponding entries in ERPNext's **Lead** doctype. Additionally, when the Lead Status is updated in ERPNext, the new status is sent back to the Meta Pixel for real-time tracking and analytics.

## Key Features

- **Automated Lead Sync**: Fetches new leads from Facebook Ads instant forms and creates them in ERPNext automatically.
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Sends updated lead statuses from ERPNext back to the Meta Pixel for enhanced tracking.
- **Customizable Sync Frequency**: Configure how often the app fetches new leads (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly, etc.).
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with Meta Business Accounts, Marketing API, and ERPNext for a smooth setup process.
- **Open-Source and Extendable**: Fully customizable to meet specific business needs.
